# Tic-Tac-Toe-Javascript-
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without any player forming such a line, the game ends in a draw.
